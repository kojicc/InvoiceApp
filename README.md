## 🧠 Thought Process & Prioritization Strategy

### 1. Foundation First Approach

**Priority: Highest**

- Started with robust data models and relationships
- Established authentication and security early
- Built scalable API architecture before adding features

**Reasoning**: A solid foundation prevents technical debt and enables rapid feature development.

### 2. Must-Have Features (Core MVP)

**Priority: High**

- Focused on the four essential features first
- Ensured each feature was fully functional before moving on
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation

**Reasoning**: Delivering a working MVP with core functionality demonstrates competency and provides immediate value.

### 3. User Experience Enhancement

**Priority: Medium-High**

- Added SWR for real-time updates (eliminates page refresh needs)
- Implemented modal confirmations for better UX
- Added responsive design for mobile compatibility

**Reasoning**: Modern users expect real-time, responsive applications. Poor UX can make even feature-rich apps unusable.

### 4. Advanced Features (Value-Add)

**Priority: Medium**

- Prioritized payment tracking (high business value)
- Added multi-currency support (scalability)
- Implemented audit logging (compliance/security)

**Reasoning**: These features differentiate the application and show understanding of business requirements.

### 5. Polish and Optimization

**Priority: Lower**

- Dark mode for user preference
- Performance optimizations
- Visual enhancements

**Reasoning**: These improve user satisfaction but don't affect core functionality.

### Technical Decision Making Process

1. **Technology Stack Selection**

   - **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript for type safety and SSR
   - **Backend**: Node.js + Express for JavaScript consistency
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data integrity
   - **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database operations
   - **State Management**: SWR for server state, Zustand for client state
   - **UI Library**: Mantine for consistent, professional components

2. **Architecture Decisions**

   - **API Design**: RESTful with clear resource separation
   - **Authentication**: JWT for stateless authentication
   - **Database Design**: Normalized schema with proper relationships
   - **Component Structure**: Atomic design principles
   - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - **SWR Caching**: Automatic data caching and revalidation
   - **Pagination**: Limiting data transfer with 10-item pagination
   - **Lazy Loading**: Component-level code splitting
   - **Database Indexing**: Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
